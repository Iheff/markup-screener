# Notes

Used 40-45 minutes to achieve intial markup in relavently named file.

Used another hour to style up, and 10-20 minutes to think about next steps and packaging the work/moving files around.

I know this is a long way from pixel perfection as most of the style is done quickly by eye (spacings etc) but I believe the underlying HTML is highly accessible/semantic and that is what should be concentrated on first in this instance.

## Next steps:

* Get Design clarification on centered column max-widths etc.
* Get Design clarifications - Styleguide reference points for spacing, inputs, typogrpahy etc.
* Full browser checking etc - VMs, ghostlab et al.
* Fragment SCSS and variablise at more places.
* Responsive web changes, the page is naturally fairly responsive, mainly the footer could do with some extra attention on smaller screens.
* Accessibility Checks. -> RNIB review?
* Images, resource retina images and/or SVG counterparts.
* Form processing, testing form sends etc, requires end point. - also check with backend that names of fields are OK for them (would probably be specified to us in advance).
* Use figure markup for diagram element.

Thank you for you time.
